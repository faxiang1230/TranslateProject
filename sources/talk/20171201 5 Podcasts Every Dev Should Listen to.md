Being a developer is a tough job, the landscape is constantly changing, and new frameworks and best practices come out every month. Having a great go-to list of podcasts keeping you up to date on the industry can make a huge difference. I've done some of the hard work and created a list of the top 5 podcasts I personally listen too.

### This Developer's Life

Unlike many developer-focused podcasts, there is no talk of code or explanations of software architecture in [This Developer's Life][1]. There are just relatable stories from other developers. This Developer's Life dives into the issues developers face in their daily lives, from a developers point of view. [Rob Conery][2] and [Scott Hanselman][3] host the show and it focuses on all aspects of a developers life. For example, what it feels like to get fired. To hit a home run. To be competitive. It is a very well made podcast and isn't just for developers, but it can also be enjoyed by those that love and live with them.

### Developer Tea

Don’t have a lot of time? [Developer Tea][4] is "A podcast for developers designed to fit inside your tea break." The podcast exists to help driven developers connect with their purpose and excel at their work so that they can make an impact. Hosted by [Jonathan Cutrell][5], the director of technology at Whiteboard, Developer Tea breaks down the news and gives useful insights into all aspects of a developers life in and out of work. Cutrell explains listener questions mixed in with news, interviews, and career advice during his show, which releases multiple episodes every week.

### Software Engineering Today

[Software Engineering Daily][6] is a daily podcast which focuses on heavily technical topics like software development and system architecture. It covering a range of topics from load balancing at scale and serverless event-driven architecture to augmented reality. Hosted by [Jeff Meyerson][7], this podcast is great for developers who have a passion for learning about complicated software topics to expand their knowledge base.

### Talking Code

The [Talking Code][8] podcast is from 2015, and contains 24 episodes which have "short expert interviews that help you decode what developers are saying." The hosts, [Josh Smith][9] and [Venkat Dinavahi][10], talk about diverse web development topics like how to become an effective junior developer and how to go from junior to senior developer, to topics like building modern web applications and making the most out of your analytics. This podcast is perfect for those getting into web development and those who look to level up their web development skills.

### The Laracasts Snippet

[The Laracasts Snippet][11] is a bite-size podcast where each episode offers a single thought on some aspect of web development. The host, [Jeffrey Way][12], is a prominent character in the Laravel community and runs the site [Laracasts][12]. His insights are broad and are useful for developers of all backgrounds.

### Conclusion

Podcasts are on the rise and more and more developers are listening to them. With such a rapidly expanding list of new podcasts coming out it can be tough to pick the top 5, but if you listen to these podcasts, you will have a competitive edge as a developer.
